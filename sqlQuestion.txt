SQL Question:
SELECT employee_id, MAX(salary) FROM employees GROUP BY department_id
would give the highest salaried employee per group with identifier but not the second for comparison

SELECT employee_id, salary FROM employees ORDER BY department_id, salary
should give the id and salary of employees ordered by dept then salary,
need to get the first and second value from each group to compare
